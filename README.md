# Greetings! üëã

Hello, my name is Tony. I am passionate about becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), and I am currently working on advancing technologies through projects that involve Large Language Models (LLMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and intelligent agents. I am proficient in Python and use frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build AI models. I also had experience in web development with React and Node.js, and mobile application development using MIT App Inventor. Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, and practicing classical singing.

## üë®‚Äçüíº Professional Roles:
- **Founder and President at App-In Club**: Inspired by youth app inventors, our mission at App-In Club is to be a global student-run non-profit impacting the world by creating apps. We believe everyone, regardless of location or background, can become an active contributor to society's future.
- **Intern at MathGPTPro**: Focusing on enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing agents capable of advanced mathematical operations.

## üîç Projects:
- **Snap Cook**: This app targets the growing global problem of food waste by transforming excess ingredients into instant recipes through a simple photo.
- **Scribe AI**: A project employing RNNs to replicate individual handwriting styles powered by a physical machine designed to write with a real pen.
- **MDRNN for Polyphonic Music Generation**: Our research utilizes a Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Network to overcome challenges in of generating "new" polyphonic music beyond its training data and repetitiveness.

üîó **Connect with Me**:
Feel free to contact me on GitHub/LinkedIn to discuss potential collaboration and ideas, or just to say hi!
